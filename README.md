# OperatingSystems
The following repository is a collection of assignments completed within my operating systems course, spanning from introductory concepts such as:
    -compiling a Kernel module (lab0)
    -accessing the /proc directory in Linux(lab1)
    -proccess information within the /proc directory(lab1)
    -use lower level C memory representation(lab2)
    
To more complex applications such as:
    -writing a shell that implements a few built-in commands and runs external programs(lab2)
    -using pthread mutexes and condition variables to synchronize threads (producer/consumer)(lab3)
    -using shell programming to list running processes using /proc interface(lab4)
    -compromise a server program using a standard buffer overflow(lab5)
